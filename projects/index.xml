      <description>The PhonePe SmartSpeaker provides instant payment confirmation to merchants at their stores in 11 languages.&#xA;I led the product launch, and built the foundational experiences that enabled PhonePe to scale rapidly on the field. These include procurement and warranty terms, design of device behaviour and firmware update mechanisms, inventory management and deployment experience for a field team of 7k+ agents, and device management experience design for the end merchants.&#xA;I worked with a wide array of platform as well as vertical teams on this project to deliver this on a tight timeline, enabling a deployment of 4 Million devices in a year.</description>

      <description>The PhonePe POS is a Point-of-Sale device to receive payments in small retail stores easily. It allows customers to make proximity payments over BLE, without needing Internet infrastructure at the store. The POS works like a calculator, and payments can be accepted by pressing just one button.&#xA;The POS is designed on top of the calculator interface to make it extremely easy for merchants to learn and use. Trustworthiness, simplicity, ease of use and low cost were important values in the design process.</description>
